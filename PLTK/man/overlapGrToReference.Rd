\title{cnTools: Maps one GRanges objec to another (Overlap)}
\usage{
overlapGrToReference(
  gr,
  ref.gr,
  int_ids = c("start", "end"),
  chr_id = "chr",
  overlap
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{[GRanges]: Input GRanges object containing copy-number elementMetadata()}

\item{ref.gr}{[GRanges]: Target GRanges object}

\item{int_ids}{[Characters]: The start and end column, shouldn't have to change this as its grabbed from getGrCoords() [default: c("start", "end")]}

\item{chr_id}{[Characters]: The chromosome id, shouldn't have to change this as its grabbed from getGrCoords() [default: "chr"]}

\item{overlap}{[Character]: The type of overlap summary metric: "mean", "median", "mode" (organized from quickest to slowest)}
}
\value{
A GRanges object of the Target GRanges object with the summarized elementMetadata() from input GRanges
}
\description{
A less senstive method compared to mapGrToReference() that maps one GRanges object (input) to a reference GRanges object (Target).  This works through the intervals package rather than the GRanges and IRanges to greatly increase the throughput.  It also operates using interval_overlaps rather than intersect to take a general "any overlap" method as compared to the aforementioned method
