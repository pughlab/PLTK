Column,Description
<chain>,"Total count of chain. Column name is name of chain TRA, TRB etc."
Reads,Total number of reads for chain
CPKR,Clones per kilo reads. Good estimate for diversity if sample is saturated
Average_reads,Average reads for clonotypes
VMR,Variance-Mean Ratio. Good metric for clonality of saturated sample
Max_reads,Maximum reads for the most dominant clonotype
Singletons,Number of clonotypes with 1 read. This is to give an estimate of the repertoire tail
Doubletons,Number of clonotypes with 2 reads. This is to give an estimate of the repertoire tail
qD,Estimate based on extrapolation to double the sample size. Should be similar to first column for saturared sample
Sample_Coverage,A rough estimate of saturation. For saturated sample this should be near 1.
observed_Richness,Sample richness (Diversity of all clonotypes regardless of their dominance). This should be equal to first column (eg TRA).
estimated_Richness,Estimated richness. For saturated data this should be close to observed richness.
SE_Richness,Standard error of estimated richness. Saturated samples should have low SE.
observed_Shannon,Sample Shannon diversity (Diversity of typical clonotypes). Good estimate for diversity if sample is saturated.
estimated_Shannon,Estimated Shannon diversity. For saturated data this should be close to observed Shannon. A reliable diversity estimate for shallow data (eg RNAseq).
SE_Shannon,Standard error for estimated Shannon.
observed_Simpson,Sample Simpson diversity (Diversity of abundant clonotypes).
estimated_Simpson,"Estimated Simpson. For saturated data this should be close to observed Simpson. For shallow data with sufficient number of clonotypes, can be used as a diversity estimate."
SE_Simpson,Standard error of estimated Simpson. Saturated samples should have low SE.
